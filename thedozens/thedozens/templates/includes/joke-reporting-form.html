      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Dozen's API intends to serve as a humorous, joyful piece of African-American culture where, as a
        community, good-hearted jokes are shared and enjoyed. To this end, please submit a joke for review if you
        feel its presence is a disservice to that end.</p>
      <h3>Review Process</h3>
      <p>Depending on the reason for the review process, a contributor to the API will review the submitted joke
        within seven working days.</p>
      <br />

      <p>In the event of any submission reason other than 'Inappropriate,' a single contributor will review the
        joke's content
        and comments provided in this submission and take appropriate action. <strong>Appropriate actions include
          but are not
          limited to the following: </strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Joke Reclassification - Changing the Joke from explicit or inexplicit</li>
        <li>Joke Recategorization - Changing the Category of the Joke to a more accurate category </li>
        <li>Joke Removal - Complete removal from the Joke Database</li>
      </ol>
